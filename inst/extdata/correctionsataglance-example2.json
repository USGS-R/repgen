There was not enough excess nitratax cable to move that over to the new section, so it was brought back to the office. There was not enough EXO cable either, so the site cable was switched to the longest EXO cable we have.\n\nIf going toward the left bank from the original installation section, you would have to move the site about 75-80ft until there is flowing water and no visible sand above the surface of the water.\n\nOnly \"after\" cleaning readings were taken, since EXO was in open air/sand.
